Library using MERN created by Marco, Art and Andrew! This will be a database where you can add the books you have read and create a favorited list and be able to add/delete books from your favorites!
This project is a milestone project for our boot camp at UNLV and will be utilizing mongodb, express, react and node.js! We hope you dig it!
