Library using MERN created by Marco, Art and Andrew! This will be a database where you can add the books you have read and create a favorited list and be able to add/delete books from your favorites on the home page!

This project is a milestone project for our boot camp at UNLV and will be utilizing mongodb, express, react and node.js! We hope you dig it!

As well as the dependencies above, we utilized MUI core material UI react component library. We also learned to seperate our frontend and backend code as well as keeping install packages in their respective folders to avoid any issues in that area.


A for the features he idea was for this application to allow us to have CRUD functions, and to have our personal manga library where we could have a home page with all the items, and edit page to update informations on the items, a create page to add new items and as well as a delete page to get rid of items. Through mongoose and postman we can do this as the 'admins', but if deployed for a user, the features we hoped to achieve did not yield the results we wanted.

Our form entry for a new item does not seem to connect to the database, nor does the edit or delete buttons to change existing items.

The home page does successfully load the entire database with no issues, and is fully dynamic so shrinking the page does not ruin the layout.
